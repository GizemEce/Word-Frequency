This is a slow train anyway, and it has slowed some more for the curve. Jackson is the only passenger left, and the next stop is about twenty miles ahead. Then the stop at Ripley, then Kincardine and the lake. He is in luck and it is not to be wasted. Already he has taken his ticket stub out of its overhead notch.He heaves his bag, and sees it land just nicely, in between the rails. No choice now the train is not going to get any slower. He takes his chance. A young man in good shape, agile as he will ever be. But the leap, the landing, disappoints him. He is stiffer than he would thought, the stillness pitches him forward, his palms come down hard on the gravel between the ties, he is scraped the skin. Nerves.
