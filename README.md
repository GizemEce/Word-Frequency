#What is Term Frequency?

TF: Term Frequency, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length,
it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is 
often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization:

TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).
